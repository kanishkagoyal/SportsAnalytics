Project name : Building a team for Chicago Bulls.

Description : In this scenario, the Chicago Bulls NBA team finished 27th out of 30 teams in the previous season, and their budget for player contracts for the upcoming season is $118 million, which ranks 26th out of 30 teams. This project aims to identify the best five starting players for the team, while ensuring that they remain within the budget.This project aims to improve the team’s overall performance by selecting the best players for the starting lineup, while also providing valuable insights to the management for future team selections.

Installation instructions: The report for this project is attached inside the folder reports. The data can be found inside the folder data separated into two folders raw & processed. One can either use R studio to run the R programming code and look at the analysis and plots. Also, one can read the report which covers most of the analysis for this project.

Summary of analysis: In this project, I was tasked with finding the best five starting players (one from each position) for the Chicago Bulls basketball team for the upcoming season. The team’s budget for player contracts was $118 million, so I had to find players who could perform well on the court without exceeding the budget.

To do this, I first obtained data on NBA players from the past season and cleaned it up, filtering out unnecessary columns and missing values. Then, I explored the data using visualizations to gain insights on how different variables were related to each other and to player performance.

Next, I performed a linear regression analysis on the data to build a model that could predict a player’s score based on their performance statistics. Using this model, I identified the players who were likely to score the highest and selected the best player for each position, considering their predicted scores and their salaries.

After analyzing the data and modeling the players, I have decided to select Angelo Russell as the Point Guard, Klay Thompson as the Shooting Guard, Khris Middleton as the Small Forward, Julius Randle as the Power Forward and Nikola Vucevic as the Center for the Chicago Bulls basketball team. I believe that these players will perform well on the court and help the team to improve its ranking in the upcoming season.
